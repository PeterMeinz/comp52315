# Access to Hamilton

For many of the exercises in the course, we will be using the
[Hamilton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/) supercomputer. You
should have already obtained an account on Hamilton as part of [Core
I](LINK). If you do not yet have one, please
[register](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/hamilton/account/#getting_account)
following their instructions. 

Since we'll be logging in a lot, I also provide some [tips]({{< ref
configuration.md >}}) on how to configure `ssh` for swifter login.
