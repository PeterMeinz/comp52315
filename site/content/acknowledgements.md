# Acknowledgements & further reading

Some of the exercises adapt material from the [HPC
group](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/) at
[FAU](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/). Their [likwid
tool](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/) is invaluable.

- [Travis Downs](https://hpc.fau.de/research/research-interests/)
  writes an interesting, and tremendously detailed, low-level
  performance optimisation and measurement blog.
- [John Regehr](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/) writes about
  [compilers](https://blog.regehr.org) often including details of
  optimisation.
- For an interesting look at how far you can go down the rabbithole of
  optimising a small piece of code, see [this sequence of
  posts](https://bits.houmus.org) on improving the performance of
  sorting small arrays by vectorisation (among other things).
