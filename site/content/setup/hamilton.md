# Access to Hamilton

For many of the exercises in the course, we will be using the
[Hamilton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/) supercomputer. You
should have already obtained an account on Hamilton as part of [Core
Ib](https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015). If you do not yet have one,
please
[register](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/local/hpc/hamilton/account/#getting_account)
following their instructions.

Since we'll be logging in a lot, I also provide some [tips]({{< ref
configuration.md >}}) on how to configure `ssh` for swifter login.

## Quickstart reminder

If you want to remind yourself of how Hamilton works, take a look at
the [quickstart
guide](https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/setup/hamilton-quickstart/#supercomputing-durham-hamilton-quick-start-guide)
from [PHYS52105](https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/).
