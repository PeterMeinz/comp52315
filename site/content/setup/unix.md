# Using Unix-like systems for computational science

This course presupposes some level of familiarity with commandline
interfaces. You have encountered these already in the previous term.
In case you need a quick refresher, I recommend the material produced
by the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) project.

They have a number of useful
[lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and materials
providing introductory training on how to do things like use the [Unix
shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [version
control](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) with git, and some
[introductory
programming](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
and [plotting](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
in Python. They are good place to start for a gentle introduction to
these topics.
